### Well hello there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Christina(she/her)

I found software development while working to improve the website for my chiropractic practice. I fell in love with development and haven't looked back. I enjoy working on a variety of projects - from developing tools for chiropractors to experimenting with security concepts through code demos. In my spare time, you can find me enjoying a great cup of coffee, exploring Nature, diving into a good book, or learning something new.
