### Well hello there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Christina(she/her)

I found software development while working to improve the website for my chiropractic practice. I fell in love with development and haven't looked back. I love creating solutions to problems, taking deep dives into the how/why things work, and continuously improving my skills. In my spare time you can find me drinking coffee, exploring Oregon, or learning something new.

### Skills
JavaScript developer with a strong focus on design, web accessibility and jamstack applications utilizing serverless technologies such as AWS and Google Cloud. I also have experience with React, Node.js and Python.
